The model.HashTable is a HashTable with separate chaining.
The available operations are:
• add: adds a new symbol in the table and returns true. If it already exists, it is not added and false is returned.
    If after adding, the number of added elements is greater than the loadFactor, the table is resized.
• getPosition: returns the position of the symbol if it exists, represented as a pair of integers which are the index
    at which the symbol is stored and the position in the bucket that it was inserted in.
• remove: removes the symbol from the table. If it does not exist, it returns false otherwise true.
• resize: resizes the table to the smallest prime number greater than double the current size
