Regex is used to match each token to a corresponding type.
The scanner receives the program as String and the list of tokens from token.in.
The method scan performs the scanning process of the program by parsing the program.
At each step comments and whitespaces are skipped and then each token is matched into the right category and added either to the
symbol table in case of identifiers or constants table in the case of int and string constants.
In the pif the string constants correspond to the value -2, int constants -1, tokens from token.in 0 and identifiers
the position in the identifier table.
The scanner also checks for errors and raises a ScannerException if an error is found.
The symbol table is written in the file ST.out and the pif in the file PIF.out.
